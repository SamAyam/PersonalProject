after troops are in position then 


click save button

(can change anchor character to someone other than player?)

get x and y distance from each troop to the anchor character

save anchor coordinates to each troop

	how do i save this so other troops can use it?

start a list, 
(first element says player or character anchor?)

for each troop in formation:
	get character type (or strength/level compared to others?)
	get anchor coordinate
	save troop object ids?
	(any other characteristics that need to be saved?)

when calling the formation function:
	(first check for object ids? only replace missing ones?)
	selected troops fill the positions until no troops left
	what to do with extra troops? repeat pattern?
	



also:
	when troops are selected change color or outline
	drag to select, even without visual rectangle at first
	if clicked/unclicked in one spot then just send the usual commands
