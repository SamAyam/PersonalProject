___________________

work notes:


make habit edit screens
	days of week screen 
	tags
	priority?
	change folder screen? or is this even applicable to habits?


finish habitButtonsScript
	move "makehabiteditbuttons" functions to the new "habit clicked script"
	design/plan those 10 buttons
	



put detete button over search button when a habit is selected
	add "selected panel" in habits, works just like selecting tasks

make task delete buttons work






make a way to un-delete things

make all option panels into prefabs, one edit changes all??

add new notebook button to note options panel

make weekly, monthly and yearly match daily layout
	copy habits options objects when they are ready
	(same with proj options)

delete buttons need to save after deleting

when viewing overdue tasks, say "overdue" instead of date


make user inputs capitalize the first letter


(zoom out with arrows all the way past year shows planner)??

make task and notes buttons (in planner view) open those screens

(fixed??): options buttons should load in a different way

make planner (daily) screen
weekly side
	month, days covered
	"this week i commit to"
	life to do
	work to do
	next weekly (or monthly, yearly) habit button?
	notes?
daily side
	day, date
	today i commit to 
	time/tasks
	"top 3"
	next daily habit button
	notes


make habits asleep screen, trash screen



test:
    make daily and weekly tasks load correctly (only show today/thisWeek)
    test monthly and yearlys
    make habits load on a given day
    make today/thisWeek button open the screen
	same with monthly and weekly
    "new do it" screen and script
	a way to delete do its
    save active screens




navigation drawer
	change dropdown to 5 toggle boxes?
make pickfolder button work
	
settings menu
	tabs:    (other tabs opened at bottom of each navigation panel)
		general senning
		task settings
		etc
	set resetdayofweek with a button in settings


make note trash screen work (and habits)
   make selectAll buttons work

when notes are view only then all inputs become noninterractable
deselect note after hitting back (button turns off window then opens it?)

make notes move to top at the end of prep screen

add datelabel to comment object
	set anchors to match tasks so date label is in the right spot after resize

comments can be moved from daily note into a folder (same dropdown as others with another value for the day)

make notes text input grow as the user types


back button opens text panel
	pressing again (while text panel is open) quits the program
	waiting a few seconds closes text panel






add "childrentasks" list
    then copy the code for projects (combine with task code?)
	


make doIts work


make tasks also grow when text gets too big?



remaining task button:
reminders, (list of date objects), screen:input field(and +), then list of reminders
	later, open app, reminders show first (then push notifications?)

add variable in new habit menu, specific days
(can/does this variable apply to weeklies?)



make projects folder/screen work
projects are tasks (with a Project label/in a diff masterList)
	projects are in a different list, have children tasks (and have a tag?)


make objects in master lists invisible?
    or behind the constant background (credits)



make morning routein open more buttons

(add priority and tags and comments to habits?)


when tasks are completed/deleted save the date when it happened
	show in done/trash view, next to the due date


make circle for reward token?

when missed habit but not reset yet, change circle to yellow (and count inARow then?) (dont get points for completing?)


make dailies, weeklies, etc different colors
same for tasks





--------------
make viewdone, viewtrash (and delete, clear)
	make emptytrash button



finish daily screen before any other screen
habit list



make edit buttons work

remember what page was active on each scene, reload that page when the scene is loaded
	(also, when saving everything, save this too)


taskFolder screen can delete taskFolders (except inbox)
	when deleted ask "do you want to delete all tasks in this folder?"
	if no: "move" all tasks in that folder to inbox 

color code project names?(and circle?)

search tasks

task/note reminders: when you open the app, reminders show first 
	(later use push notifications instead?)

view button?



layoutview(cmt#)
on layout view use userTags to put in the boxes for that day
	if duedate==today and usertag == theTagForThisBox
	click box to create/edit task in box
	also create daily/weekly task with proper tag and due date will put task in box
		userTag = "focus" => task goes in "focus for the day"
		daily but no tag => task goes in the first of 3 empty unscheduled slots
screen split:
	click bar at the top of each to full size that side (like in viewBoth tasks screen)
	left side has this weeks focus/priority, then work checklist, then life checklist, then nextHabitButton then weekly notes
	right sides shows date, then has todays focus/priority, then list of blank (or filled) tasks from 5AM-7PM(color shows if task is optional), then 3 blank boxes for task (daily task with no tag), then nextHabitButton, then daily notes
	how do habits get put in this -> (nexthabit button under weeklyChecklists/3dailyUnscheduled)



_______________________________
maybe later (test first):



if the cursor moves off viewport when the note grows, move the viewport


make function to check missed days?
	instead of logging on every day

[[
my single selected: dates, edit, comments, reminders, done
